## How to Set Environment Variables in Vercel

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Select your PropertyMasters UK project
3. Navigate to Settings â†’ Environment Variables
4. Add each variable with its corresponding value
5. Make sure to set the environment to "Production"
6. Redeploy your application after adding all variables

## Important Notes

- Replace all placeholder values with your actual API keys and configuration
- The `VITE_API_URL` should point to your Supabase project URL
- Ensure all API keys are valid and have proper permissions
- Test the deployment after setting all environment variables

## Security Considerations

- Never commit actual API keys to your repository
- Use Vercel's environment variables feature for all sensitive data
- Regularly rotate API keys for security
- Monitor usage of third-party services to detect any unauthorized access
